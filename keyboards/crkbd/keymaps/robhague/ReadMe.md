# Rob's Corne Layout

 A *very* personal layout for [Corne/HeliDox](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd). While it's probably not useful for others directly, it may serve as inspiration. Notable points:

- Little finger, right hand never need to move off its home row position (as mine can't easily). In particular, P is in the usual location of semicolon
- Home row mods: Option-Control-Command-Shift
